# What is this?

![blog](https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/icons/png/write_wordpad-0.png) Read my [blog post](https://blog.simone.computer/bluesky-firehose-is-cool) about this project!

The social network Bluesky is built on a protocol called the AT Protocol. This protocol enables real-time access to all posts as they're written by users. This service is called [Firehose](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/firehose). Firehose messages can be decoded using a simple WebSocket listener on a [Jetstream server](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream), which handles JSON encoding, bandwidth reduction, and other useful tasks.

tl;dr: What you see on the screen is a live feed of posts written by Bluesky users, displayed in real time as a Matrix-style rain animation.
